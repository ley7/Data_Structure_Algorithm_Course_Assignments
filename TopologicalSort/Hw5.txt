Time complexity: O(V+E). Firstly, the program scans the data from the txt. The time complexity is O(E). In the process of building graph, because I use Map, 
the complexity of get and search function is O(1). Then the complexity of the DFS is O(V+E). Finally, because the requirement says that I should use string 
representation, so I define the function toString.This function need to scan all the vertices in the graph, so the complexity is O(V). In all, the complexity is O(V+E).

Space complexity: O(V+E). The space complexity of the map storing edges is O(E).  The space complexity of the map storing vertices is O(V).
The space complexity of sortedList to store the the result is O(V).So the total space complexity is O(E+V)
