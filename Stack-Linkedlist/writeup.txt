1.I'm sorry that I wrote the analysis of complexity at the end of typescript in the Assignment 1 last time, I copy them here below.
2.I have modified the codes, now it can vary the input automaticly.It is in the attacchment of this email.
3.In addition, I didn't find the mistake until yesterday that my file hw1dlist turned in last time is all messy codes. But the file in my Unix account is correctly and it 
could run properly(you can see my typescript turned in last time). I'm sorry that maybe when I move the file from the Unix account to my computer, I did some operation and 
the format of the file changed and it caused the messy code.I'm very sorry for this mistake and this time I turn in the correct file in my attachment.I hope this could help.

1.1 Stack
Complexity
the complexity of the push and pop is O(1). Because push and pop operations both have noting to do with n, no matter how big the n is, the operation of 
push operation is to do the operation to add a node after the last node(top) and the operation of pop is to delete the last node.So the complexity of 
the push and pop is O(1)

1.2 Doubly Linked List
Complexity
the complexity of the search operation is O(n). Considering the worst case that the node we need to search is the last node of this DoubleLinkList, 
so in this case we need to traverse all the nodes to compare with the node we want to search. In this case big O is n. So the the complexity of the  search operation is O(n)
